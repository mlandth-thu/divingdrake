# Diving Drake

## Description
This is a tiny java-fx application that was inspired by the famous game flappy bird.<br>
The drake has to swim against a hefty wind blowing from the north and has to care not to float off the map.<br>
The drake is following the stream down the river, but must avoid logs crossing his way.

You can move upwards by pressing "w" and downwards by pressing "s".
